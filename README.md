# 🎹 MIDI Toolkit

MIDI Toolkit is a web based set of tools, utilities and debugging aids for working with MIDI, features:

- Realtime monitor & logging for incoming MIDI messages, with decoding
- Configurable input & output devices, & MIDI channel setting
- Clock & sync: detect & send MIDI clock
- Send MIDI CC and NRPN messages
- Two octave keyboard for sending & testing note data
- Send & test MIDI program change and bank select (new in v1.2!)

It's 100% browser based, nothing to install and being a static web app it requires no backend. [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) was used (and slightly abused) as a lightweight framework for all DOM interaction and reactivity and  provides a SPA like experience without React or Vue.js!

There is no build or webpack bundling required as modern ES6 modules are used. 

## 🚀 Try it out!

Deployed is hosted on GitHub Pages here: https://code.benco.io/midi-toolkit/

Note. You will need a MIDI device attached to your machine 😁. The app is not designed for mobile use, don't even think about it.
