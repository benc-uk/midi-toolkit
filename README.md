# MIDI Toolkit

This is a HTML5 & JS based tool kit for working with MIDI, features:

- Realtime monitor & logging for incoming MIDI messages, with decoding
- Clock & sync: detect & send MIDI clock
- Send MIDI CC and NRPN
- Two octave keyboard for sending note data
- Configurable input & output devices, with MIDI channel setting

It's 100% browser based, nothing to install and being a static web app requires no backend. [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) was used as a lightweight framework for all DOM interaction and reactivity.

There is no build or webpack bundling required as modern ES6 modules are used. 

## Try it out!
